# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering processes to design software using various processes and procedures

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
software crisis and rise of structured programming-in the early days software deveelpment was chaotic which led to over budget projects that were inefficient thi led to the develpment of structured programming
object-oriented programming-allowed developers to model real world entities as objects
the agile revolution-addressed the need for greater flexibility in programming compared to the late models

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning-defines project objectives and identifies resources needed for the product to be made
requirement analysis-involves understanding user needs and business objectives
design-involves designing theuser interface data base and system components
coding-actual software is written
testing-the product is tested and checked for errors
deployment-the product is made available to the users by putting it on various platforms 
maintenance-the product is frquently upgraded and fixed so that it can run more efficiently according to the users desires

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology follows a strict proggression of phasesand each face should be completed before the next begins.this is suitable in places where changes are costly such as construction sites whereas agile methodology divides the process into sprints which makes it more flexible than waterfall methodology.this comes in handy where the project requires frequent updates and releases .
waterfall and agile methodologies are both goal oriented and also emphasise on planning.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer-writes,tests and maintains coe
quality assuarance engineer ensure the software products meet quality standards are free os defects
project manager-oversee the planning,execution and completion and software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDESs increse pruductivity and enhance code quality example:visual studio(microsoft)
VCSs enables collaboration and maintains a complete history of all changes madeto the codebase example:Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide stra
tegies to overcome these challenges.
maintaining code quality and standard-this can be overcome by reviewing the code and constant upgrades
security concerns-incorporate security best practices in all stages of coding
time management-utilise time management techniques to prioritise tasks and meet deadlines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-involves testing the smallest testable parts of an application called units this enables early defect detection
intergretion testing-this focuses on testing the interactions between different units or modules of an application this verifies the system is running as expected
system testing-this evaluates the complete,intergrated system againstits specified requirement thisoffers full system validation
acceptance testing-detrmines whether the system meetsthe customer and user's acceptance criteria  thisoffers customer's satisfactory

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
promp engineering is crafting clear and specific instructions to an AI model to produce good and desired responses-this allows fo the AI model to function at its full capacity and also give accurate solutions

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
write about cars-write about the exaust of the posche 911 gt3rs
the word "cars" is very broad and would prompt the AI to write a lenghthy history about cars but the improved prompt is clear and specific on the type of car and the topic that you would like the AI model to expand on
